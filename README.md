# Medical Clinic Defensive Strategy Proposal

This repository provides a defensive strategy presentation for a medical clinic, proposing infrastructure enhancements to improve network security. The presentation covers existing and target network architectures, infrastructure components, new roles, documentation requirements, and a cost analysis to support the proposed improvements.

## Files in this Repository

- **DefensiveStrategyPresentation.pdf**: A slide presentation proposing a network security defensive strategy, including infrastructure upgrades, role definitions, policy requirements, and a detailed cost analysis.

## Project Overview

### 1. Current Network Architecture
An overview of the clinic's current flat network design where all devices, including workstations, imaging devices, and servers, are connected to the same router. This architecture lacks segmentation and advanced threat protection.

### 2. Target Network Architecture
The proposed network structure focuses on **Network Segmentation** and **Defense in Depth** strategies:
- **VLAN Segmentation**: Divides devices into VLANs to isolate traffic by device type, reducing attack vectors.
- **Enhanced Access Controls**: Firewalls, ACLs, and multi-factor authentication limit unauthorized access.
- **Data Protection**: Encrypts sensitive data at rest and in transit.

### 3. Infrastructure Components
Additional components recommended to enhance security:
- **Firewalls**: For segmenting the network and restricting access.
- **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS)**: For monitoring and responding to threats.
- **Network Access Control (NAC)**: Ensures only authorized devices can connect.
- **SIEM**: Centralized event logging and analysis for comprehensive visibility.
- **Data Encryption Solutions**: Encrypts sensitive data.
- **Endpoint Protection Platforms (EPP)**: Provides malware and threat protection for endpoints.

### 4. Roles and Responsibilities
To manage the enhanced infrastructure, new roles are proposed:
- **Network Security Engineer**: Designs and implements network security measures.
- **Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst**: Monitors and responds to security incidents.
- **Patch Management Team**: Handles timely patching of vulnerabilities.
- **Application Security Team**: Conducts assessments and ensures secure coding.

### 5. Documentation Requirements
Key documents required to support the enhanced infrastructure:
- **Network Security Policy**: Guidelines for network security.
- **Incident Response Plan**: Steps for identifying and responding to incidents.
- **Access Control Policy**: Authentication and access guidelines.
- **Data Encryption Policy**: Standards for protecting sensitive data.
- **Patch Management Policy**: Process for applying updates and patches.
- **Backup and Recovery Plan**: Procedures for data recovery.

### 6. Cost Analysis
A breakdown of component costs and justifications for each investment:
- **Total Cost**: $51,000 for firewall, IDPS, NAC, SIEM, encryption, and endpoint protection solutions.
- **Justification**: This investment will enhance the clinic's security posture, reduce risks, and ensure regulatory compliance.
